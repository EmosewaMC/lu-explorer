<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>This web-application is designed to be an exhaustive resource on
  the content of the latest published version of the now discontinued
  game <b>LEGO Universe</b>. It is implemented as a wiki-esque interface
  to <a href="https://github.com/xiphoseer/lu-json">LU-JSON</a>, which is
  a machine-readable and preprocessed export of the games' database and files.
  The images that this app uses are taken from
  <a href="https://github.com/xiphoseer/lu-res">LU-RES</a>, which mirrors the
  game resources but in modern / web-compatible formats.
</p>
<p>
  This unique approach means that LU-EXPLORER is able to replicate much
  of the content that would otherwise only be available in the traditional wiki at
  <a href="https://legouniverse.fandom.com">legouniverse.fandom.com</a>, and also
  provide the necessary technical detail and metadata to understand how the systems
  in the game worked.
</p>
<p>
  This project was created by <a href="https://xiphoseer.de">@Xiphoseer</a>
  and has a GitHub repository located at
  <a href="https://github.com/xiphoseer/lu-explorer">https://github.com/xiphoseer/lu-explorer</a>.
  Feel free to report any issues or suggestions
  <a href="https://github.com/xiphoseer/lu-explorer/issues/">there</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, none of this would have been possible without the amazing work by the folks
  at NetDevil and the LEGO Group, which are listed in the <a routerLink="/dashboard/credits">LU Credits</a>!
