<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>This web-application is designed to be an exhaustive resource on
  the content of the latest published version of the now discontinued
  game <strong>LEGO&reg; Universe</strong>. It is implemented using
  a <a href="/api/">REST API</a> that serves data from a game client
  in web-compatible formats. This unique approach means that LU-EXPLORER
  is able to replicate the majority of the content that is available in the
  traditional wiki at <a href="https://legouniverse.fandom.com">legouniverse.fandom.com</a>
  in a way that's much closer to the original game mechanics.
</p>
<p>
  This project was created by <a href="https://xiphoseer.de">@Xiphoseer</a>
  and has a GitHub repository located at
  <a href="https://github.com/xiphoseer/lu-explorer">https://github.com/xiphoseer/lu-explorer</a>.
  Feel free to report any issues or suggestions on the
  <a href="https://github.com/xiphoseer/lu-explorer/issues/">issue tracker</a>.

<p>
  Finally, none of this would have been possible without the amazing work by the folks
  at NetDevil and the LEGO Group, which are listed in the <a routerLink="/dashboard/credits">LU Credits</a>!
